Artificial Teeth Scheduling Problem Instances for MiniZinc Challenge 2021:

The model is taken from the ICAPS 2021 paper:
"Automated Production Scheduling for Artificial Teeth Manufacturing" from Winter et al.
https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/ICAPS/article/view/15997

== Main Model File ==
atsp.mzn

Instances are based on real-life instances (but slightly shrinked so that they are not too challenging for exact solvers)
